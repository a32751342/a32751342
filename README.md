### 🌟 Featured Project: Computer Vision-Based Baseball Swing Analysis

This project is an intelligent analysis system inspired by MLB Statcast, designed to provide objective, data-driven feedback on a baseball player's swing. By tracking bat and ball trajectories in real-time, it calculates key performance metrics essential for player development.

- **Key Features**:
  - Tracks bat and ball movement from standard video feeds.
  - Calculates critical metrics like **Exit Velocity**, **Launch Angle**, and **Bat Tilt Angle**.
  - Provides a foundation for advanced biomechanical analysis and performance evaluation.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - `Python`, `OpenCV`, `YOLOv8`, `PyQt6`, `NumPy`, `CUDA`
